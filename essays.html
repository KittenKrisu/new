            <p>O! A pleasure to get acquainted with a driven successor of Cornelius Agrippa.</p>
            <p>Victor, you refuse to speak and let the Rays enter your work.</p>
            <p>Dwindling in solitude with “greatness” quenching your thirst</p>
            <p>So “great” a man that Copernicus’s absurd ideas of geocentrism comes to life.</p>
            <p>You challenge nature and mold an Adam</p>
            <p>That even the Almighty Lord is envious.</p>
            <p>When Adam awakes, however, you hide.</p>
            <p>And when its powerless hands clench,</p>
            <p>You worry about YOUR future</p>
            <p>But what about your Elizabeth?</p>

            <p>Wasting time, energy, and concentration</p>

            <p>Your mighty hands tremble</p>
            <p>That at Justine’s trial, not a word comes out of your lips</p>
            <p>So prudent and “thoughtful”</p>
            <p>You gave mercy to those who were innocent as a mockingbird</p>

          <p>This ode was inspired from Mary Shelley's book, <i>Frankenstein</i>, as it mocks the brokenness Victor Frankenstein experiences from his own actions. He gives life to a creature that brings about destruction, similar to how God formed humans only to see the disastrous results of their wickedness and sinful states. Through this piece, it critizes the selfishness of Victor Frankenstein. He wasted his good talents into what started as an evolutionary project into one that brought about death, sorrow, and destruction. This answers to the prompt of what makes a monster, as it demonstrates that a monster is one who introduces harm to others. Frankenstein built a creature that killed others in hatred for mankind. However, this could have been prevented if Frankenstein displayed sympathy and openmindedness to the Creature's situation. As an "ugly" outlier, the Creature was only hurt from Frankenstein's works. Frankenstein abandoned the Creature and cause it to experience the pain of rejection and feeling of unwantedness. Frankenstein is the destructor of life and killer of mankind.</p>

            <p>The winds were rashly blowing as it sliced through the trees in the dark, desolate night.Shrieks and cries were heard, as it echoed through the trees and throughout a small town. In the confined space, a woman was breathing deeply as she clung onto her husband while their eldest son, Dustin, quickly called the ambulance and pressed the emergency button on the door’s nearest exit. After many difficulties, the woman overcame death and her son, Orion, entered the world. Orion was born on Friday, April 13th, in a small town in Yorkshire, England.</p>
            <p>He was a shriveled, scrawny baby that constantly cried, even upon his first breath as a baby. His loud screams and tantrums soon developed into a habit that Orion's mother became used to.</p>
            <p>Orion’s family were a part of the lower middle class. The family was living with Orion’s father making five pounds per hour working as a bartender while his mother made six pounds per hour from her shifts as a waitress at a local restaurant. They had Dustin when they were 23 years old and Orion seven years after. Barely living off of corn soup and one loaf of bread twice a day, the family of four lived in an old, crackdown house in North Yorkshire.</p>
            <p>Dustin studied hard and affirmed to become a judge one day, in order to give his parents a comfortable life as well as prove to the world a “poor” boy deserves more than pity. He earned respect and acknowledgement. On the other hand, Orion was always cared for by both his older brother and parents, who cherished the youngest.</p>
            <p>When Orion was seven years old, his father won the lottery, which was the beginning of the family’s glorious wealth and the end to the cramped, impecunious lifestyle. In order to make up for their sons’ limited lifestyle prior to winning the lottery, Orion’s parents spoiled their children by granting every wish they had and solving everything with money. Dustin saved all his allowances and cautiously used the resources his parents gave him. On the other hand, Orion bathed himself in his new luxurious lifestyle and he continuously began to spend whimsically. His parents supported him throughout high school, college, graduate school, and the start of his career. Orion’s life was comfortable, but he wanted more.</p>
            <p>Orion was easily persuaded by the scheming businessmen and companies eyeing him for his wealth. He invested in stocks and shares without giving it a second thought. Everything around him measured up to how much, status, and power. Now, in his 20s, Orion’s parents became wary of their son’s obnoxious spending and carelessness. Orion also became engulfed in his spending. On August 8th, 2078, debt collectors pounded his house door. His habits of gambling and investments in stocks led to a downfall in profits.</p>
            <p>Hopeless and in despair, he did what he was best at. He approached his parents and demanded more money from them. Orion’s parents were tired and worried, which forced them to deny their son. He was deprived of the family’s bank account, savings, and partnering investors.</p>
            <p>Every curve, corner, and route he turned, he met a dead end. No one was lending a hand. His family turned against him and he was getting shut out from his social circle. Orion began to lose sight. He was lost. He was broken. He was furious.</p>
            <p>Tormented, frustrated, and hungry for money, Orion’s anger reached a peak, where he utilized all his brain power to discover a solution. It was simple.</p>
            <p>“Why didn’t I think of this before?”, he wondered with a hollow look.</p>
            <p>Late at night, he approached his parents’ house. Haggard looked and soulless, his parents welcomed him into their house without question. His genuine face and hollow eyes warmed his parents as he was granted a place to stay for the night. In the pitch, eerie night, the wind sang its sorrowful tune. The window shone a lean, dark shadow, and it emitted a foul odor. Night moaned and the moon illuminated its light towards the house. As it watched over the house, night retired and the birds chirped a melancholy song. It was a bright day, yet the light had other intentions in mind. Lying on the bed, the dead lay and was never to be heard again. Orion paid his debt and he was liberated from his hellish isolation. He grew the family’s wealth, more calculative than before. Sympathy, compassion, and family was foreign to him. He lived his remaining days of his life remembering the eerie night as it haunted his nights. As for his parents, they never shut him out again and only the night remembered what happened that fateful day…</p>

              <p>The short story above came from many inspirations. Assigned first as a project in class, this piece became one that reflected a type of monsters that are viewed within society today, which is one that is willing to do anything to reach one's goal. Like Machiavelli's quote, "The ends justifies the means", this story demonstrated the extreme actions people will take in order to reach their desires, for people become desperate during dire situations. The characters within this story were crafted to reflect that of a classical Korean news headlines of a rich family going corrupt. It is common in Korea to hear published articles of rich children using corrupt methods in order to become the heir of their family's wealth, obtain a share or contract, or abandon their parents in order to receive benefits. These common headlines and discussions that I have heard from the Korean community inspired me to reveal a monsterly characteristic about humans, which is that the environment in which a person is raised in affects their approaches to difficult situations. In order to add the eerie, uncertainty element,I set the story to be at Yorkshire, which was the same setting that Emily Bronte created for her book <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. This classic story demonstrated spooky effects that leave readers to question and think again about the turnout of events.</p>

        <!--In the class below put whether it is an essay or poem by just putting essay or poem in the quotes-->
        <div class="essay">
            <p>Monsters have always been a vocabulary within the English language. Whether it was to characterize a type of person, a fictional character, or an adjective, the word “monster” had a negative connotation that inflicted terror onto the reader. Moreover, worldwide, the term “monster” has been interpreted in various ways, particularly in stories. In Japan, monsters are called yōkai. Michael Dylan Foster of Indiana University Bloomington explains how the yōkai are diverse in origin; branched off from the Chinese culture, the yōkai were incorporated in folktales at local villages (Kumagi). The Japanese have more than 300 types of yōkai, such as the kamaitachi, gumiho, and the tsurube-otoshi. Many of the folktales that the Japanese orally shared or wrote about were explaining the flaws of society - concerns the culture had. Some of these concerns were death and foreign invasion. The Japanese believe that there are ghosts that haunt the Earth exacting revenge on humans. The monsters come in many forms but a particular creature that reveals about the insecurities of the human heart is the Kuchisake-onna, the Slit-Mouthed Woman.</p>
            <p>Jealousy consumes humans. It is the most dangerous form of emotion they can feel which clouds the individual from the realities of society or the truth. Kuchisake-onna was a beautiful woman who was married to a samurai. However, during her lifetime, different versions explain how she got mutilated from ear to ear. Legend states that her adultery caused her to be punished by her husband; however, other tales inform readers that her beauty caused other women near her to be jealous, which resulted in her fatal face distortion. In order to conceal her condition, the woman wore a mask. From then on, she has targeted her victims, asking them if she was beautiful. Whenever the victim would answer “no”, she would kill them with her weapon, a scythe. If the person answered “yes”, she would proceed by giving them follow up questions, everytime revealing a little bit more of her face. In the end, if the individual, after witnessing her bare face, replies “yes”, she would slice their face to replicate hers.</p>
            <p>The anger the woman had was consuming her, causing her to irrationally see her situation realistically. She believed that her face resulted as so, which meant that the rest of society must suffer with her. Her pride in her physical looks led her to view the world with hatred and impartiality. Moreover, originated from the Japanese culture, it imparts to young individuals and women to be faithful to their husbands. The nation’s strict traditionalist values of the home life and being respectful towards one another is reflected through this tale - the consequences of disrespecting fellow human beings and how jealousy can consume an individual.</p>
            <p>The insecurities the Kuchisake-onna faces results in her confronting others to tell her who she is as an individual. She is essentially living based on other people’s critiques about her, for she is consumed about how others think about her. This is an important characteristic for a monster, for monsters are products of their peers’ actions. They discern and think from what the general population defines them. Most importantly, the fact that Kuchisake-onna haunted young children shows how she targeted the pure, innocent ones; children tell the truth and are the simplest, truest representations of what one can get as an answer. Thus, the confrontation the Kuchisake-onna makes reveals not only her reliance but her incapabilities to control her thoughts. </p>
            <p>Wandering around the Earth seeking a “satisfied” answer, the Kuchisake-onna lures innocent children to respond to her how she sees fit. However, this also demonstrates how her ability to judge and filter ideas that are detrimental to herself is completely broken. She is a broken individual. She is in a deep, dark, lonely hole, where she believes that her life is worthless. Thus, she makes it her life duty to make other people’s lives miserable and torturing. The Kuchisake-onna, although a monster, imparts qualities that could have been seeked for attention. The insularity and confinement causes her to become hesitant with her actions.</p>
            <p>The Kuchisake-onna’s influence over the Japanese children resulted in hysterical fear; some parents have even prevented their children from leaving the house in fear that the Kuchisake-onna would stalk them to answer her questions. However, on a global scale, the monsterly figure and folktale from Japan has spread throughout the rest of the world to inspire new generations of films. The fictional character is suggested to have aspired to the creation of the Joker and the evolution of other film works produced in Japan (Penn State).</p>
            <p>The definition of what makes a monster and how one can become one is an ambiguous question that can be interpreted in various ways. However, through the Japanese culture, it can be seen that a monster is derived from an individual’s incapabilities to control their inner emotions that one harbors. Furthermore, the Kuchisake-onna is one of many monsters within the Japanese culture that extremely interpreted her insecurities to inflict fear and hurt upon others unrelated to her incident.</p>

              <p>The classic Japanese tale of the Kuchisake-onna was inspired from my mentor and role model. Her stories and teachings allowed me to remember a Japanese legend, which was a perfect character to demonstrate another interpretation of my understanding of the essential question. This character demonstrates the most explicit side of monsters, which is that one's flaw or lack of something can lead one to become obsessed over it. In the informative writing above, the Kuchisake-onna experienced an unfortunate event, where her husband abandoned her and left a gift on her face - long streaks on the ends of her mouth. Her scarred face caused her to view herself unworthy of others and a shame to her identity as a women in the Japanese culture. Instead of adapting to her new face, she condemned society and decided to inflict the same pain on children and women. This demonstrates the insularity and irrationality of the character as her developed hatred for society caused her to find pleasure in scarring others. Essentially, this monster explains how if she is unable to experience happiness and beauty, others should not have it as well.</p>

            <p>Humans are not born as a clean slate. Rather, they are conscious people that can discern right and wrong; furthermore, some actions they make are due to malice or contempt. In 2013, Dr. Karen Wynn, a researcher at Yale University’s Infant Cognition Center, and her team published that all babies are born with a moral code (“Born”, 2013). A series of tests were performed to display the infant’s preferences and the thought process during decision-making. Not only were the experiments directed towards babies, but Dr. Paul Bloom, a professor of psychology and cognitive science, also carried out similar studies on children above the age of five. By showing that human beings are capable of differentiating what society accepts to be moral and unethical, the questions of how one becomes a monster, avoid becoming one, and the origins of the term demonstrated throughout centuries, became a complex and nuanced question. Lady Macbeth in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Perry Smith in Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood, and the Creature in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, all are consumed with resentment, filled with contradictions, and have a tendency to treat others as a means to an end; their lifestyles, however, cause the three people to resort to violence. </p>
            <p>Hate or disagreement causes all three characters to feel the need to exert their dominance and control. Assertiveness leads the individuals to resort to extreme methods, killing other people in order to fulfill their resentment built up within them. Lady Macbeth demonstrates this quality when receiving Macbeth’s letter in Act 1 (Macbeth, 1.5.38-41), where she is against the idea of King Duncan visiting their estate and her having to serve him during his stay. Moreover, she is dissatisfied with her current status in Scotland and desires for more. Her negative outlook towards life causes her to consistently build up her dislike for the current present. This mindset and frustration is an important factor in contributing to her road in becoming a monster, one that is immune to empathy and rationality to properly assess one’s situation with an appropriate answer. Perry Smith also has a similar turn out in events, for he resents his family background. His upbringing was one that was discriminated against and abusive. Unlike his siblings, he was sent to a Catholic school and eventually had to be under the care of his father (Capote, 185). Perry feels his unfair treatment and underprivileged life is the reason why his life as an adult is terrible. He blames his upbringing as an excuse to resort to the violent wishes that his conscience tells him. Through his hatred for his father and his sister, he, too, becomes a homicidal killer that becomes a psychopath. Finally, the Creature came into this world without a family or a caretaker. His abandonment and constant insecurity of his appearances lead him to live his life hiding where humans cannot see him (Shelley, 15.8). However, this insecurity becomes a challenge for him to approach a family that he observes cautiously. The Creature’s rejection causes him to feel confused, which turns into disgust for humans. His hopeless mindset and pent up anger has unresolved conflict. The Creature’s bitterness contributes to his monsterly qualities of violence and irrational qualities. </p>
            <p>Monsters are those who experience a state of conflict, where the individual is torn apart between the two sides - anger and moral compass. Lady Macbeth demonstrates this after she kills Duncan (Macbeth, 2.2.58-59). In the beginning, her composure keeps her husband together and voices out her “innocence” publicly. However, as the thought of murdering someone keeps bothering her daily activities as more bloodshed pursuits when Macbeth becomes a madman, Lady Macbeth experiences an internal torment. Although she realized the unbearable consequences of slaying the innocent, Lady Macbeth chose to be adamant about her actions as she ignored her blood-stained hands, which was soon plagued with guilt. She chose to satisfy her self-desires at the expense of others. By giving into her lust and whimsical desires, she is insular to the subsequent events that follow after, which is her delirious state of mind and eventually her death. Similarly, Perry Smith in Capote’s work experienced cognitive dissonance when neglecting his chances to start anew after his release from prison. Instead of pursuing his intellectual curiosities within the arts, Perry’s entanglement with Richard causes Perry to psychologically experience a killing spree phase after he kills the Clutter family, which contributes to the transformation of becoming a monster. Another example was the Creature who experienced the reality of human interactions after revealing himself to the DeLacy family. His denial and rejection goes against his observations of human beings - respectful and caring towards one another. The negative interactions he experiences trigger his violent nature, causing him to become homicidal. The Creature was unable to express its feelings and internal rage from the pain he experienced, which led him to resort to irrational methods in order to fulfill his needs and frustrations. This conflicted with his need for intimacy as he inflicted pain onto those who mocked him. Moreover, it causes him to be torn between intimacy and violence, where he goes against himself when coping with his emotions. Through Lady Macbeth, Perry Smith, and the Creature, all three have realized that their actions contradict with their moral code, which is then dealt with through sporadic, violent actions, causing them to fall deeper into the serial killers they are. </p>
            <p>With prominent criminal records, the three characters’ confliction in original thought leads them to confess their actions. Their burnt up anger is resolved with violence, and eventually causes them to do whatever methods to become the definition of “the ends justify the means.” The three individuals finally give into their inner conflicts, which leads to each character confessing their sins publicly. Lady Macbeth resolves her conflictions by committing suicide (Macbeth, 5.5). Her bold actions and constant hearing of voices lead her to feel terrible about herself. Perry realizes in prison of the pointlessness in life before the trial. This causes him to confess in front of the court of his actions - how he was the one to kill Mr. Clutter and the rest of his family (Capote, 244). The Creature ends up killing multiple people, even his creator, which makes him realize that his actions affect others’ lives and eventually death. He spends the rest of his life hiding and avoiding humans. The three characters’ fall helps them to understand that their irrational actions and thoughts lead them to be the ones to be impacted by them. </p>
            <p>Each character has different approaches in resolving their conflicts. Through these approaches and processes of thought, each is able to have different justifications for their road to becoming a monster. For Lady Macbeth, she utilizes other people in order to accomplish her goals; she urges her husband to commit the murder of Duncan. She encourages her husband to become a maniac killer, who starts to see ghosts and mutters prophecies. As the playmaker, she controls her next victims specifically her loved ones in order to do whatever it takes to reach her goal, becoming queen. Perry’s family background and abusive childhood gives him motivation to ruthlessly kill the Clutter family; moreover, he continues to follow Richard without thinking through the consequences of his actions and decides to justify his actions through excuses. Finally, in the beginning of the story, the Creature first approaches Victor, his creator, with an open, hopeless heart, begging him to consider his propositions. He is willing to comply with the creator’s thoughts and discuss his past before demanding for his partner. Unlike the other characters, the Creature takes time and energy to rationally get his opinions through. He even listens to Victor’s words, but ends up getting hurt from the creator’s unwillingness to construct a companion. Each character justifies that the final actions are either because of power, traumatic memories, or the desire for love. However, each resorts to violence, the brutal interactions of them and their civilizations demonstrate their prominent monsterly qualities - capability of carrying out violence and becoming the destructor of human life. </p>
            <p>Monsters, from three prominent characters from different time periods, are those that cannot formulate and rationalize before committing an action. Moreover, Lady Macbeth, Perry Smith, and the Creature fall into this pit by utilizing violence as an instrument of their motivations to carry out their pains while ignoring their morals for their own self-interests.</p>

              <p>The comparison essay above is similar to the short story, in which the monsters are in pain from society's mistreatings and are expressing their hatred through irrational means. Despite knowing that the actions the characters are committing are wrong and immoral, they decide to proceed with their actions for temporal pleasure and fulfillment. Moreover, the resentment and tainted hands causes the monsters to continue to go down the route of evil. This comparison essay was inspired from three novels that I had read in class, which were <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>In Cold Blood</i>, and <i>Frankenstien</i>. The characters experience internal conflict, which demonstrates that they realize how immoral it is to kill another person, yet chooses to ignore their conscience in order to make others feel the terror that they experienced. It is essentially a means to an end, but a particular reason why each character is different is due to the variety of environments in which they were raised and developed.</p>

            <p>Politicians and serial killers are some of many people who are characterized as “monsters”. A monster is often referred to as an individual inflicting fear to another. The idea of a monster has become more complex to give it different definitions of what it means to be a monster. A monster is one that has the following characteristics: an extremist who cannot control one’s ambitions, one who controls the amount of knowledge others can obtain, and a manipulator who will use whatever or whoever it takes to reach one’s goal; moreover, Kurtz from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Beatty from Fahrenheit 451, and Cassius from The Tragedy of Julius Caesar are three characters who demonstrated these three attributes.</p>
            <p>As an extremist, Kurtz’s ambitions to become a god over the natives and mine the Congo for ivory sucked rationality out of him. Initially, he ventured out to the heart of Africa to enlighten the “savages” inhabiting within and extract resources for the Belgian company that he worked for. However, the idea of power and unlimited control over his actions caused him to lose morale. His methods and actions became that of an extremist, possessive as was unflinching to compassion. Kurtz needed to have tight control over his properties, ranging from materialistic values to people to authority. As a meticulous individual with an enlightened mind, his time in the Congo allowed him to become more manipulative and was able to lead the natives by asserting his authority over them. Not only did he declare his superiority over the natives and the other white explorers, but he was able to gain their respect, which turned to idolization as the people viewed Kurtz as their key to survival. Moreover, his obsession turned to an illness, causing his physical body to become weak to the terrors of his mind. The freedom of power led to his downfall. Kurtz’s quality may have started out admirable and respectful, but later resulted in consequences he could not live through. Through this example, Kurtz sheds light on what makes someone become a monster and how this attribute is unique to the idea of a monster. Extremists have no control or boundaries to what is appropriate and what is not. Their idea of control is pushing every idea to its maximum, leaving their moralities to achieve greatness. Often, they look at situations then advocate for a severe and irrational action, contrary to the norms advocated by society, which is considered standard and conventional. Their course of action excludes their peers as it centers solely around finding methods that can fully achieve their intentions, desires, and thoughts. From this thought process, it affects the people near the extremist’s plans or those directly involved, for they are merely chess pieces sacrificed for the greater goal of the extremist’s views. Without control, one becomes a monster, to one’s body, heart, mind, and to the world.</p>
            <p>Knowledge is key to success; however, when one gains access to the power of learning and tries to control others’ from becoming intellectually informed, that is a sign of monster-like behaviour.. Beatty, like any other person, was ignorant and controlled by the government. Society demanded that he burn books, and he listened. However, Beatty realized that books were equivalent to knowledge, a form of power, which he feared. It had the power to inform and teach others of the world through the lenses of multiple thinkers, debaters, philosophers, and writers. Literature stimulated thought as it brought an end to the technological reliant society that was controlled by the government’s police forces. To Beatty, this was a form of treason, for it was contradicting the political and societal values of the authorities, specifically the firefighter institution. Learning and reading taught people to make their own conclusions, which was something that limited Beatty’s power as someone working for the authorities. The most important action that Beatty took to categorize himself as a person with a monsterly attribute was his incapability to share what he learned. Keeping to himself and unable to vocalize about his knowledge, Beatty’s mind was overwhelmed from the confusions and differences he experienced from reading the books. He was able to see what others could not. He was able to understand what others took for granted. Most importantly, he was able to feel what others could not, for the books helped him to develop an independent mindset. Beatty’s inner conflict and torture he experienced caused him to turn to violence to burn the books more passionately. He wanted to burn everything that was causing this grief and confusion. The unfamiliarity was causing his brain to rely on what he knew best to do: burning books. </p>
            <p>A manipulator is often interpreted as a calculating person who is able to control the victim’s mind and emotions on the tips of their fingertips. Cassius utilized Brutus’s emotions and gullible self to turn against Julius Caesar. He was able to reveal to Brutus his true desires and used Rome as a justification to him approaching Brutus. Cassius’s calculating mind warned Caesar, for the man’s face expression reflected danger. Although Cassius approached Brutus saying how he was here to help the noble, it was clear that Cassius was only using Brutus as a stepping stone for his glory. If someone was to twist the morale of another and pinpoint the weak points within the individual, it is a sign of the person being aware of having power over another and purposefully exploiting that advantage to harm others. can be understood as a strength for the individual; however, it can also mean that the person has great influence in using someone to do what they see fit. A strong principle and quality of a monster is someone who can use their peers as weapons to clear their path to their success. Praised as a genius in society, these types of people are the ones that can misabuse their talents to turn to evil. A monster doesn’t have to reveal itself in the open light for others to blatantly criticize and fear. Rather, the playmaker or the puppetmaster behind the stage is the true master of darkness.</p>
            <p>A monster has many attributes in terms of action. However, the main three qualities are their incapability to control one’s ambitions, their inner conflict with one’s knowledge, and their ability to manipulate the victims around him or her. Monstrosity is born from the person through their actions and how they discern the situations presented to them at hand.</p>

              <p>This final writing piece was inspired from three major works that I had analyzed during class, which were <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, and <i>The Tragedy of Julius Caesar</i>. Moreover, each book reminded me of three different characters who all classify under this one idea of a monster, yet have different attributes that define it so. The variety within this essay allowed for me to not only answer the essential question in three different ways, but it also allowed me to further analyze why the characters demonstrate these qualities that can be adapted to humans within our society. The first monster defined within this essay is an extremist who is obsessed over his properties. The next type of monster is one who wants to control other people's knowledge intake in order to make themself superior over others. The idea of gaining knowledge frightens the one with power, which causes for them to find methods in which one can become ignort or censored to the knowledge of the world. Finally, the last type is one who manipulates for one's own benefit. It's like they are playing a game of chess, and in order to win the game (game of life in this case), they would need to use their weaker pieces to bait out the enemy and attack with stronger pieces in order to circle around their goal.</p>

    <!--Final thing-->
        <div class="titlepage">
            <div id="center">
                <h3>Throughout this 19/20 school year, the essential question proved to be not the simple answer that I initially thought it would be. Moreover, the constant debates, discussions, and readings during class allowed for me to get a deeper insight to what makes a monster and how we can become avoiding one. My take on this is that a monster is one that is developed from a traumatic or painful experience in which one goes through. The person is hurt and abandoned, sometimes betrayed by society. Yet, they are left to survive on their own and undergo the mental struggles of combating the hatred, fear, and irrationality after the experience. They then become a monster, one who cannot sympathize for others or see the world through the conventional lenses, which causes them to be pushed out by society more due to their differences. They are outcasts of society, but the now the question lies is: what could have have changed if someone did approach them. That is the second part of the question, in which I believe is still something I have to analyze. One can avoid becoming a monster by reading books and talking to a variety of people. We human beings are born to have social interactions with others and to learn. Books help us to see the world in multiple perspectives, for variety of people with different beliefs are writing them. Monsters are developed from humans, but we can undue our monsterly actions through our humanly characterisitcs.</h1>
